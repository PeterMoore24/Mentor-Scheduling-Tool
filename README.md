# Mentor-Scheduling-Tool
A program to automatically assign mentors to the shifts that they are available to.

~~Step 1: Unzip the downloaded .csv.zip file.~~

~~Step 2: Read the resulting csv file.~~

~~Step 3: Parse the csv file.~~

  ~~Step 3.5: Organize the mentors and their responses.~~

Step 4: Assign mentors to events.

Step 5: Create Google Calendar-compatible output.

Completing step 5 will be enough for the initial ASU 101 events.

Step 6: Create human-readable and editable output.

Step 7: List mentors who are also available for events yet were not chosen in the human-readable output.

Step 8: Spread mentors out across events (would mentors prefer to have several shifts on one day or one shift on several days?)

Step ???: Have the mentors fill out a when2meet-style form, and do everything else automatically!
