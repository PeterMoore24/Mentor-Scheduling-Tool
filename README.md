# Mentor-Scheduling-Tool
A program to automatically assign mentors to the shifts that they are available for.

~~Step 1: Unzip the downloaded .csv.zip file.~~

~~Step 2: Read the resulting csv file.~~

~~Step 3: Parse the csv file.~~

  ~~Step 3.5: Organize the mentors and their responses.~~

~~Step 4: Assign mentors to events.~~

~~Step 5: Create Google Calendar-compatible output for events and human-readable output for list of mentors.~~
> Note: This will require that advisors manually add mentors to events.

Completing step 5 will be enough for the initial ASU 101 events.

~~Step 6: Create human-readable and editable output.~~

~~Step 7: List mentors who are also available for events yet were not chosen in the human-readable output~~

Step 8: Don't assign mentors to consecutive events that happen within some time of each other or overlap.

Step 9: Convert Google Calendar-compatible output to .ics format; automatically invite mentors.
> Step 6a: Attach timestamp to output file.
> This should probably be a separate step so that advisors can manually edit the mentor assignments first.

Step 10: Take in both Google Form output as well as a sheet provided by the advisors to create a single form with all of the information needed to use it.
> This would allow for a simplified Google Form while still outputting details like which advisor will be working on a date and other event-related information.

Step 11: If an event has only one mentor who is available for the event but they do not have the capacity to take the shift, the program should attempt to have a different mentor take one of their shifts to give them capacity to take the shift.

Step 12: Spread mentors out across events (would mentors prefer to have several shifts on one day or one shift on several days?)

Step ???: Have the mentors fill out a when2meet-style form, and do everything else automatically!
